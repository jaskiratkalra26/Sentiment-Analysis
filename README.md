🎬 Movie Review Sentiment Analysis using BERT
This project focuses on building a sentiment analysis model to classify IMDb movie reviews as positive or negative using powerful BERT-based word embeddings.

🚀 Overview
Utilized the bert-base-uncased model from Hugging Face Transformers to extract deep contextual word embeddings from raw movie reviews.

Preprocessed and tokenized over 50,000 reviews from the IMDb dataset.

Serialized embeddings using Pickle for efficient reuse.

Trained a classification model on the BERT embeddings to predict sentiment polarity with 92% accuracy.

Evaluated model performance and ensured robust data handling and preprocessing workflows.
